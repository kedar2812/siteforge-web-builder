### SiteForge Website Builder

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a React-based visual website builder, bundled with a set of pre-designed templates and a modern design system. It is built with Vite and TypeScript, and styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui components.

You can use this project to:

- **Visually compose landing pages and sites** using a component-based builder.
- **Preview and export templates** as static HTML/CSS.
- **Customize styles and content** through a responsive, accessible UI.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

If you need Node.js, you can install it with nvm by following the instructions in the nvm repository.

### Installation

Clone the repository using your Git URL:

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser. The app will automatically reload as you edit files.

## Project Structure

High-level structure:

- **`src/`** – Application source code
  - **`App.tsx`** – Root application component
  - **`main.tsx`** – Entry point that mounts the React app
  - **`pages/`** – Top-level routes (Builder, Dashboard, Landing, Templates, Settings, etc.)
  - **`components/`** – Reusable UI and feature components
    - `builder/` – Core builder UI and layout
    - `design-system/` – Design system elements
    - `ui/` – Shared UI primitives (buttons, dialogs, inputs, etc.)
  - **`hooks/`** – Custom React hooks (e.g., template loading, toasts, mobile handling)
  - **`store/`** – Client-side state management for templates
  - **`utils/`** – HTML export, template parsing/editing utilities
  - **`contexts/`** – Context providers (e.g., authentication)
- **`public/`** – Static assets, including:
  - `templates/` – HTML/CSS for pre-built templates
  - `thumbnails/` – Template thumbnails (PNG/SVG)
  - `favicon`, `manifest`, `robots.txt`, service worker
- **`dist/`** – Production build output (generated by Vite)
- **Configuration files** – `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`, `eslint.config.js`, etc.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm run dev`** – Start the development server.
- **`npm run build`** – Create a production build in the `dist/` directory.
- **`npm run preview`** – Preview the production build locally.
- **`npm run lint`** – Run linting on the codebase (if configured in `package.json`).

Check `package.json` for the full list of scripts.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

- **Vite** – Fast build tool and dev server.
- **React** – Component-based UI library.
- **TypeScript** – Typed JavaScript for safer, more maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework.
- **shadcn-ui** – Accessible, themeable component library on top of Radix UI.
- **ESLint** – Linting and code quality.

---

## Editing the Code

You can use any workflow you prefer:

- **Local development with your IDE**
  - Open the project in VS Code, WebStorm, or any other editor.
  - Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
  - Edit files in `src/` and see changes live in the browser.

- **Editing directly in Git hosting**
  - Open the repository in your Git hosting platform.
  - Navigate to a file and use the built-in editor to make changes.
  - Commit and push your changes as usual.

- **Cloud-based development environments**
  - Launch a cloud IDE or codespace connected to your repository.
  - Install dependencies and run the dev server inside that environment.
  - Commit and push when done.

---

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will output static assets to the `dist/` directory. You can serve these using any static hosting service or web server.

To verify the build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```

---

## Deployment

Since the build output is static, you can deploy the contents of `dist/` to any static hosting provider, such as:

- A static site provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
- A traditional web server configured to serve static files.
- Object storage with website hosting enabled.

Typical deployment steps:

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Upload the `dist/` directory contents to your hosting provider.
3. Configure your host to serve `index.html` for unknown routes (for SPA routing).

Refer to your hosting provider’s documentation for details on setting up continuous deployment from your Git repository if desired.

---

## Custom Domains

To use a custom domain with your deployed site:

1. Deploy the production build to your hosting provider.
2. Configure DNS records (usually an `A` record or `CNAME`) to point your domain to the host.
3. Follow your host’s documentation to enable HTTPS and finalize the domain setup.
